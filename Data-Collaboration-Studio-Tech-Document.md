## 1. Problem Statement with Objectives

### 1.1 Current Challenges

Organizations today face significant challenges in data collaboration that hinder business agility and data-driven decision making:

#### **Fragmented Data Collaboration Processes**
- **Manual Data Handoffs**: Business users rely on email, tickets, and spreadsheet-based processes to share datasets across teams
- **Inconsistent Data Quality**: No standardized validation or quality checks, leading to downstream pipeline failures
- **Lack of Governance**: No centralized audit trail of who contributed, reviewed, or approved data changes
- **Siloed Operations**: Each department (marketing, risk, analytics) maintains separate data workflows with incompatible processes

#### **Operational Inefficiencies**
- **Time-to-Value Delays**: 2-4 week lead times from data submission to activation due to manual review cycles
- **Resource Bottlenecks**: Data engineering teams overwhelmed with ad-hoc data requests and transformation tasks
- **Duplicate Efforts**: Similar data validation and transformation logic rebuilt for each use case
- **Limited Visibility**: Business users have no insight into data processing status or approval workflows

#### **Compliance & Security Risks**
- **PII Exposure**: No automated detection or masking of personally identifiable information
- **Access Control Gaps**: Inconsistent permissions and role-based access across different data sources
- **Audit Trail Deficiencies**: Limited ability to track data lineage and demonstrate compliance with regulations (GDPR, CCPA, SOX)
- **Data Classification Issues**: Manual tagging of sensitive data leads to misclassification and potential breaches

#### **Scalability Limitations**
